## Methods
  * [global static pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitResponse submit(pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitRequest request)](https://help.certinia.com/TechnicalReference/2025.1/ProfessionalServicesAutomation/Apex/PSATimecardService.htm#submit0)
  * [global static pse.PSATimecardService.SaveResponse save(pse.PSATimecardService.SaveRequest request)](https://help.certinia.com/TechnicalReference/2025.1/ProfessionalServicesAutomation/Apex/PSATimecardService.htm#save0)

submit _global static pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitResponse submit(pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitRequest request)_ This method is the preferred way to submit timecards for approval. This method only sets the Status field, typically customizations will be in place to set the Submitted field and actually enter the record into a Salesforce Approval Process. After performing some validations it updates the Status field to Submitted. (This value is customizable through custom setting Timecard Entry UI Global - Timecard submit button action.) The validations performed are: 
  * The timecard has not yet been submitted. 
  * You are not attempting to submit a timecard with zero hours logged if this is forbidden by settings. (For more information, see Timecard Entry UI Global - Submit timecard with zero hours.) 
  * The timecard currently has a status that allows it to be edited. (For more detail, see Global Timecard Entry UI - Timecard Edit Status Values.) 
  * The linked project is active. 
  * The timecard is not invoiced or billed. 
  * The user has permission to edit this timecard. 

If some records fail validation, other records will still be submitted.
#### Input Parameters
| Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
request | [pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitRequest](https://help.certinia.com/TechnicalReference/2025.1/ProfessionalServicesAutomation/Apex/PSATimecardService.htm#SubmitRequest) | Request indicating Timecards to be submitted  
#### Return Value
A response object containing a success flag and potential validation messages.
#### Sample Code
```
//Note: This sample code is for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for
//use in a production environment, is not guaranteed against defects or errors, and
//is in no way optimized or streamlined.

//I have a timecard header that I want to submit. The id is 'a431D00000000snQaH'

//Create the request
pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitRequest request = new pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitRequest();
request.TimecardIds = new Set<Id>{'a431D00000000snQaH'};

//Call the service to submit
pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitResponse response = pse.PSATimecardService.submit(request);

//Check the results
Map<Id, List<String>> failureReasons = new Map<Id, List<String>>();
for (pse.PSATimecardService.SubmitResult result : response.Results) {
    if (result.Successful) {
        //Great, no action required. But you could report the success if necessary.
    } else {
        //We need to inform the user why their timecard could not be submitted.
        //Depending on the use-case we could show messages on the UI, or email or do anything.
        failureReasons.put(result.TimecardId, result.Errors);
    }
}
if (!failureReasons.isEmpty()) {
    informUser(failureReasons);   
}

```

save
_global static pse.PSATimecardService.SaveResponse save(pse.PSATimecardService.SaveRequest request)_
This method saves the information in the request by creating or updating Timecard_Header__c records and Timecard__c records. It can also create and update records in Task_Time__c when time is being logged on tasks. If some Timecards fail validation or fail with DML errors the other changes will still be saved. The response object provides details about which records failed and why, as well as the Id of newly created Timecards.</p>   
It is possible to change the project a timecard is linked to with this method, which is generally not possible with native edits. Changing the project is audited on the record.   
It performs the following validations: 
  * The timecard is linked to an active project. 
  * If the timecard is linked to an assignment, then the assignment is not closed for time entry. 
  * If the timecard is linked to an assignment, and required by settings, the period of the timecard overlaps the linked assignment. (For more information, see Timecard Entry UI Global - Assignments load date restriction.) 
  * If the timecard is not linked to an assignment, then the linked project is not closed for time entry. 
  * If the timecard is not linked to an assignment, and required by settings, the period of the timecard overlaps the linked project. (For more information, see Timecard Entry UI Global - Projects load date restriction.) 
  * If the timecard is linked to an assignment, its Status is in the list indicated in Timecard Entry UI Global - Assignments load status values. 
  * Billable timecards are not logged on non-billable assignments. 
  * If the timecard is billable and not linked to an assignment, ensure the project is billable. 
  * The timecard is not for zero hours if this is forbidden by the config Timecard Entry UI Global - Save timecard with zero hours. 
  * No days have negative hours recorded if this is forbidden by the config Timecard Entry UI Global - Allow timecard with negative hours. 
  * That daily notes are provided, if the project or assignment indicates this is required. For more information, see Daily Timecard Notes Required fields on Project and Assignment. 

  
These extra validations are performed only when updating timecard records: 
  * The timecard is not already billed or invoiced. 
  * The timecard status is one that allows the timecard to be edited. (For more information, see Timecard Entry UI Global - Timecard edit status values). 

  
If the request is logging time against tasks, a check for duplicate Task Time records is performed; each Timecard can have at most one Task Time linking it to a given Project Task. If this request would create more than that an error is added to the response.

#### Return Value
A response object containing details about successes and failures.
#### Sample Code
```
//Note: This sample code is for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for
//use in a production environment, is not guaranteed against defects or errors, and
//is in no way optimized or streamlined.
