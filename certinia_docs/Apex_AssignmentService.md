updateTimecardRollupsAsync _global static Id updateTimecardRollupsAsync(Set <Id> assignmentIds)_ Recalculates fields on Assignment whose values are calculated from Timecards linked to the assignment. This version may run asynchronously to handle large volumes of data. If you want the calculation performed immediately, call AssignmentService.updateTimecardRollups(Set<Id> assignmentIds) instead.   
The fields that will be updated are: 
  * pse__Billable_Amount_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Billable_Amount_Submitted__c
  * pse__Billable_Days_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Billable_Days_Submitted__c
  * pse__Billable_Hours_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Billable_Hours_Submitted__c
  * pse__Non_Billable_Days_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Non_Billable_Days_Submitted__c
  * pse__Non_Billable_Hours_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Non_Billable_Hours_Submitted__c
  * pse__Timecard_External_Costs_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Timecard_External_Costs_Submitted__c
  * pse__Timecard_Internal_Costs_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Timecard_Internal_Costs_Submitted__c

Note that PSA's triggers will keep these fields up to date. However it may be necessary to call this method to correct data in some situations, for example when an assignment is closed.
#### Input Parameters
| Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
assignmentIds | Set<Id> | The assignments on which to recalculate the timecard rollup fields.  
#### Return Value
The Id of the ApexAsyncJob that performs the calculation. Note this job may create other async jobs. So the rollup process might run for some time after the job in the return value has completed.
#### Sample Code
```
//Note: This sample code is for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for
//use in a production environment, is not guaranteed against defects or errors, and
//is in no way optimized or streamlined.

//Recalculate all Timecard data on all assignments on the 'Consulting 2017' project.

for (pse__Assignment__c asmt : assignments)
{
    assignmentsToRecalculate.add(asmt.Id);
}

Id jobId = pse.AssignmentService.updateTimecardRollupsAsync(assignmentsToRecalculate);

```

updateTimecardRollups
_global static void updateTimecardRollups(Set <Id> assignmentIds)_
Recalculates fields on Assignment whose values are calculated from Timecards linked to the assignment. This version will execute synchronously, but may fail with large volumes of data. If the calculation needs to handle large numbers of timecards or assignments, call AssignmentService.updateTimecardRollupsAsync(Set<Id> assignmentIds) instead.   
The fields that will be updated are: 
  * pse__Billable_Amount_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Billable_Amount_Submitted__c
  * pse__Billable_Days_In_Financials__c

  * pse__Non_Billable_Days_Submitted__c
  * pse__Non_Billable_Hours_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Non_Billable_Hours_Submitted__c
  * pse__Timecard_External_Costs_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Timecard_External_Costs_Submitted__c
  * pse__Timecard_Internal_Costs_In_Financials__c
  * pse__Timecard_Internal_Costs_Submitted__c

Note that PSA's triggers will keep these fields up to date. However it may be necessary to call this method to correct data in some situations, for example when an assignment is closed.
#### Input Parameters

}

pse.AssignmentService.updateTimecardRollups(assignmentsToRecalculate);

```

updateExpenseRollups
_global static void updateExpenseRollups(Set <Id> assignmentIds)_
