A service that queries the Resource (Contact) object using filters for security controls, region/practice/group, skills, utilization, and others. Queries can be set to return resources that do not exactly match the filter criteria (fuzzy matching). When fuzzy matching is enabled, depending on a specified preference resources may be returned that do not match the region, practice, and group filters. Certain additionalContactFilters can also be set to fuzzy match when fuzzy matching is enabled. (Currently the only additionalContactFilter that can be set to be fuzzy is resource role.) The level of preference for these filters can be defined by weightings in the Resource Search Service custom settings. The priority of weightings is Essential (must match), Ideal, Desirable, then Suggested. When using fuzzy matching the returned resources are ordered so that the best matching resources occur first. This order supersedes any requested order specified by the filter's orderByFields. A good match is determined firstly by how well the filter criteria match, then by the overall skill ratings, and finally the availability.
## Methods
  * [global static List<Contact> execute(pse.ResourceSearchService.ResourceSearchFilter filter)](https://help.certinia.com/TechnicalReference/2025.1/ProfessionalServicesAutomation/Apex/ResourceSearchService.htm#execute0)
  * [global static String debug()](https://help.certinia.com/TechnicalReference/2025.1/ProfessionalServicesAutomation/Apex/ResourceSearchService.htm#debug0)
  * [global ResourceSearchService()](https://help.certinia.com/TechnicalReference/2025.1/ProfessionalServicesAutomation/Apex/ResourceSearchService.htm#ResourceSearchService0)

execute _global static List <Contact> execute(pse.ResourceSearchService.ResourceSearchFilter filter)_ The execute method searches for resources that meet the supplied criteria. Note if the search criteria use encrypted fields, the results cannot be sorted or filtered and an error displays.
#### Input Parameters

#### Return Value
Returns a list of Contact records with the requested fields and skills, and optionally additional utilization related fields.
